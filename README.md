This repo stores code meant to execute curved space simulations primarily with the help of CGAL. 

TODO
-improve shift routine to work not only for shifts within a face and shifts into faces with two 
 shared vertices, but also shifts into faces with only one shared vertex
-move in Mathematica test files so that they are part of the git repo
-improve repo organization so it is easy to find specific components
-write more in README so the repo is navigable and intelligible
